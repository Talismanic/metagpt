## Original Requirements

build a software which will have a UI and a backend. In UI we will show 3 input field, name, email and password. there will be a signup button. Once user press the signup button we will call a backend api. backend will check whether the email is unique or already existing in user table of database. database is a postgres db. If user present with email, it will throw error sayin user already exists. UI will show the error. If the user is new unique user, then backend will send an email to the user's provided email address with a verification link. once the user verify the link, user will be active in user able. Then we will have next UI, where the user will give the email and password. if the combination matches, we will show a welcome UI to user.

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements focus on creating a user-friendly signup process with email verification. The backend must ensure email uniqueness and handle user data securely. The UI should provide clear feedback to users during the signup and login processes.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement user signup with name, email, and password fields.']
- ['P0', 'Create backend API to check email uniqueness.']
- ['P0', 'Send verification email upon successful signup.']
- ['P1', 'Develop UI for user login with email and password.']

## UI Design draft

The UI will consist of a clean layout with three input fields for name, email, and password, along with a prominent signup button. After signup, a message will indicate the need to check the email for verification. The login UI will have fields for email and password, with a clear welcome message upon successful login.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific design preferences for the UI and any additional features that may be required post-login.
