build a software which will have a UI and a backend. In UI we will show 3 input field, name, email and password. there will be a signup button. Once user press the signup button we will call a backend api. backend will check whether the email is unique or already existing in user table of database. database is a postgres db. If user present with email, it will throw error sayin user already exists. UI will show the error. If the user is new unique user, then backend will send an email to the user's provided email address with a verification link. once the user verify the link, user will be active in user able. Then we will have next UI, where the user will give the email and password. if the combination matches, we will show a welcome UI to user.
